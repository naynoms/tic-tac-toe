#TIC TAC TOE


This is a very basic game of Tic Tac Toe a.k.a. Naughts and Crosses. Done as Project 0 for General Assembly.


###Process

Designed to look like the pen and paper version of Tic Tac Toe. Player 1 always goes first, fight over who takes the x just like when you were young. Get your parents to mediate. The score keeps tracking until the page is refreshed.


###Challenges

As the first 'major' project from start to finish I've completed there were many challenges.
Setting up class and ID names to be intuitive and readable was not something I did well in this code. It became especially difficult when adding to the code to get the desired outcome.
I'm not sure how well I stuck to the KISS principle.


###Triumphs

I am most happy with the fact that I was able to deliver something that matches the aesthetic vision I had when fist planning this game.
